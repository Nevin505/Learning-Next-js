# 🍴 Foodiea Shop

**Foodiea Shop** is a simple food ordering web app built while learning **Next.js (App Router)**.  
This project helped me explore concepts like routing, image optimization, and using custom hooks in Next.js.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
- **React**
- **CSS / Tailwind CSS** (depending on setup)
- **Next Image Component**
- **Custom React Hooks**

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

During this project, I focused on learning and experimenting with:

1. **Next.js App Router** — understanding server and client components, layouts, and nested routes.  
2. **Image Optimization** — using the `next/image` component to handle images efficiently.  
3. **Hooks in Next.js** — creating and using custom hooks for managing logic and states.  
4. **Dynamic Pages** — rendering product or food item pages dynamically from data.  
5. **File-based Routing** — exploring how pages and layouts are structured automatically in the App Router.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- How **Next.js App Router** changes routing and rendering compared to the Pages Router.  
- How to use the **`<Image />`** component for automatic image optimization.  
- How to write and integrate **custom hooks** (`useFetch`, `useCart`, etc.).  
- How to structure a project cleanly for scalability.
